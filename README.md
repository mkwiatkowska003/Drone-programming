The project contains a set of python algorithms for a simple drone control using MAVSDK library. Most of them can be run as a standalone application. Images in the specified directory could be replaced with any pictures you want to use in the process. 

# Requirements
All programs requires installed Python 3.6 with the MAVSDK tools, a real drone connected to your computer and configured correctly. Installing QGroundControl could be helpful for calibration and real-time telemetry control.

# Tasks and missions
